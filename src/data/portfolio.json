        "description": "Learning about the archeitrure of a web 3 application and how it differs from traditonal web applications always captured my attention. This web page displays the 24 hour revenue of fees for each of the major cryptocurrency's.  This table displays the 24 hour fee in dollar amount, the logo, the name and the ticker of each coin. A great way to track the success of a crypto project is to see if it is making revenue which can be tracked with on-chain data.  This transparency is another amazing part of the web 3 movement and blockchain technologies.",
